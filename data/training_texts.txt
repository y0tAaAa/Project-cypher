The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
To be or not to be that is the question
All that glitters is not gold
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
Knowledge is power
Time heals all wounds
Actions speak louder than words
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Every cloud has a silver lining
Fortune favors the bold
Practice makes perfect
Where there is a will there is a way
Birds of a feather flock together
A picture is worth a thousand words
Better late than never
Easy come easy go
First things first
Good things come to those who wait
Home is where the heart is
If you want peace prepare for war
Keep your friends close and enemies closer
Life is what happens while you make other plans
Money does not grow on trees
No pain no gain
One man's trash is another man's treasure
Prevention is better than cure
Quality over quantity
Rome was not built in a day
Silence is golden
The early bird catches the worm
Unity is strength
Victory belongs to the most persevering
Wisdom comes with age
You reap what you sow
Zero in on your goals
A friend in need is a friend indeed
Better safe than sorry
Curiosity killed the cat
Do not count your chickens before they hatch
Every dog has its day
Failure is the mother of success
Great minds think alike
Honesty is the best policy
In unity there is strength
Justice delayed is justice denied
Keep your head up
Love conquers all
Make hay while the sun shines
Never give up
Opportunity knocks but once
Patience is a virtue
Quality time is better than quantity time
Reading is to the mind what exercise is to the body
Strike while the iron is hot
Time and tide wait for no man
